# 🎬 Movie Discovery App

A responsive and modern movie discovery application built with React, Tailwind CSS, and The Movie Database (TMDB) API. This project allows users to browse popular films and search for movies by keyword, with real-time results and error handling.

> This application was developed as part of a hands-on tutorial to deepen my understanding of React fundamentals, hooks, component architecture, and API integration.
